/**
 *
 * Error codes
 *
 *
 * | CODE |	DESCRIPTION |
 * |-------------|--------------|
 * |200 |	OK - The request has succeeded. The client can read the result of the request in the body and the headers of the response. |
 * |201 |	Created - The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. |
 * |202 |	Accepted - The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. |
 * |204 |	No Content - The request has succeeded but returns no message body. |
 * |304 |	Not Modified. See Conditional requests. |
 * |400 |	Bad Request - The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The message body will contain more information; see Response Schema. |
 * |401 |	Unauthorized - The request requires user authentication or, if the request included authorization credentials, authorization has been refused for those credentials. |
 * |403 |	Forbidden - The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. |
 * |404 |	Not Found - The requested resource could not be found. This error can be due to a temporary or permanent condition. |
 * |429 |	Too Many Requests - Rate limiting has been applied. |
 * |500 |	Internal Server Error. You should never receive this error because our clever coders catch them all â€¦ but if you are unlucky enough to get one, please report it to us through a comment at the bottom of this page. |
 * |502 |	Bad Gateway - The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server. |
 * |503 |	Service Unavailable - The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. You can choose to resend the request again. |
 *
